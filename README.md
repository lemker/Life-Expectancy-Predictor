# Life-Expectancy-Predictor
Life expectancy is one of the best indicators of a country's success. A high life expectancy usually means the country and its citizens are living well. Through feature selection, we try to find if mortality rates are a good predictor of life expectancy. From apriori inspection, we can assume mortality rates must have an impact on life expectancy. This report and program we created is built using three mortality rate attributes, but can fundamentally use any features for prediction. The prediction program could be able to determine future life expectancy of a country based on current trends in the data.
